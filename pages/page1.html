        Because narrative paragraphs resemble fiction (an untrue story), you have a little more freedom to write the story in the style you prefer. This is known as artistic freedom or artistic license. You can use the first person narrative style and include words that clearly refer to you (I, me, my, mine, etc.), or you can try to tell the story from a purely objective point of view that is not personal, but gives a straight-forward, factual account of what happened.

That's a good assignment because it allows you to write in the first person and the details in this kind of paragraph are likely to be very vivid. Here's an example:
